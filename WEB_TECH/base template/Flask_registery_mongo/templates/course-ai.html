            <h3>Week 1: Introduction to Artificial Intelligence</h3>
<p>This week covers the foundational concepts of AI, its history, and its applications across industries. You’ll understand what AI is, its subfields, and its importance in modern technology.</p>

<p><strong>1. Understanding Artificial Intelligence:</strong> Artificial Intelligence (AI) refers to the simulation of human intelligence in machines. Learn about how AI enables machines to learn, reason, and perform tasks like recognizing speech, playing games, and making decisions that usually require human intelligence.</p>
<p><strong>2. Types of AI:</strong> There are three main types of AI: Narrow AI (specialized in one task), General AI (which could theoretically perform any intellectual task that a human can), and Super AI (hypothetical AI that surpasses human intelligence). Examples include Siri (Narrow AI) and speculative systems like the AI in science fiction movies (General and Super AI).</p>
<p><strong>3. The Turing Test:</strong> Proposed by Alan Turing, the Turing Test evaluates a machine's ability to exhibit intelligent behavior indistinguishable from a human. If a machine can convince a human that it is also human, it is considered "intelligent."</p>
<p><strong>4. History and Evolution of AI:</strong> AI has evolved from early theories in the 1950s to modern developments in machine learning and deep learning. Significant milestones include IBM’s Deep Blue defeating chess champion Garry Kasparov and Google DeepMind’s AlphaGo winning over top Go players.</p>

            <h3>Week 5: Introduction to Computer Vision</h3>
<p>This week covers the fundamentals of computer vision, including image processing techniques, popular computer vision models, and applications. By the end of the week, you’ll be familiar with key concepts that allow computers to "see" and interpret images and videos.</p>

<p><strong>1. What is Computer Vision?</strong> Computer vision is a field of AI that enables machines to interpret and make decisions based on visual data, similar to how humans process visual information. It is widely used in applications like image recognition, object detection, and autonomous driving.</p>

<p><strong>2. Basics of Image Processing:</strong> Image processing is essential for preparing images for computer vision tasks. Techniques like resizing, cropping, grayscale conversion, and edge detection (such as using Sobel and Canny filters) enhance images for analysis.</p>

<p><strong>3. Image Representation:</strong> Understand how images are represented in digital form, as grids of pixels, where each pixel has color values (RGB channels for colored images). This representation is the basis of image processing in computer vision.</p>

<p><strong>4. Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs):</strong> CNNs are a type of deep learning model specifically designed for image data. They use convolutional layers to detect spatial hierarchies in images, identifying edges, textures, and shapes. CNNs are foundational for computer vision applications.</p>

<p><strong>5. Convolution and Pooling Operations:</strong> Convolution applies filters (kernels) across images to detect features, while pooling reduces the spatial dimensions, making computations more efficient. This combination allows CNNs to recognize patterns in images.</p>

<p><strong>6. Image Classification:</strong> Image classification involves categorizing images into predefined classes. For example, identifying whether an image contains a cat, dog, or other object. CNN-based models, such as ResNet and VGG, are popular for image classification tasks.</p>

<p><strong>7. Object Detection and Localization:</strong> Beyond classification, object detection identifies specific objects within an image and provides their locations. Techniques like YOLO (You Only Look Once) and Faster R-CNN are used for real-time object detection in applications like surveillance and autonomous vehicles.</p>

<p><strong>8. Image Segmentation:</strong> Image segmentation divides an image into multiple segments or regions for detailed analysis. Techniques like semantic segmentation label each pixel with a category (e.g., “sky,” “road”), while instance segmentation distinguishes objects within each category.</p>

<p><strong>9. Face Recognition and Detection:</strong> Face recognition systems identify or verify a person by analyzing facial features. Applications range from smartphone authentication to security surveillance. Key techniques include feature extraction and comparison against a database of faces.</p>

<p><strong>10. Applications of Computer Vision:</strong> Explore real-world applications of computer vision, such as autonomous vehicles (detecting lanes and obstacles), medical imaging (analyzing X-rays and MRIs), augmented reality (AR), and optical character recognition (OCR) for digitizing text in images.</p>

<p><strong>11. Transfer Learning in Computer Vision:</strong> Transfer learning involves using pre-trained models on large datasets (e.g., ImageNet) to quickly develop custom models. This approach is cost-effective for specialized applications, as it reduces training time and data requirements.</p>

<p><strong>12. Challenges in Computer Vision:</strong> Computer vision faces challenges such as handling varying lighting conditions, image quality, and occlusions (when objects are partially blocked). Additionally, achieving high accuracy in real-time applications requires substantial computational resources.</p>

<p><strong>13. Tools and Libraries for Computer Vision:</strong> Familiarize yourself with popular libraries such as OpenCV, TensorFlow, and PyTorch. OpenCV provides powerful tools for image processing, while TensorFlow and PyTorch support deep learning model development.</p>

<p><strong>14. Hands-On Project: Image Classification with CNNs:</strong> Implement a CNN for a basic image classification task. Start with a simple dataset, like CIFAR-10, and learn how to preprocess the data, build a CNN model, train it, and evaluate its performance on test data.</p>

<p><strong>15. Ethical Considerations in Computer Vision:</strong> Computer vision raises privacy concerns, especially in applications like facial recognition. Understand the importance of responsible use and ethical guidelines, including data privacy and consent when using images for training models.</p>
