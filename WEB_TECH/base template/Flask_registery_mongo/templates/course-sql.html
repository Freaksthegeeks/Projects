            <h3>Week 1: Introduction to SQL and Basic Queries</h3>
<p>This week introduces SQL basics and provides a foundation in querying data from databases. You'll learn about database structure, data retrieval, and filtering.</p>

<p><strong>1. Introduction to Databases and SQL:</strong> Understand what a database is—a structured collection of data that can be easily accessed, managed, and updated. SQL (Structured Query Language) is the language used to interact with databases, helping to store, retrieve, and manipulate data.</p>

<p><strong>2. Setting Up SQL Environment:</strong> Learn to set up your SQL environment by installing a database management system (DBMS) like MySQL, PostgreSQL, or SQLite. Familiarize yourself with using a SQL client (e.g., MySQL Workbench or pgAdmin).</p>

<p><strong>3. Basic SQL Syntax:</strong> Study the fundamental structure of SQL commands. Learn how SQL statements are structured, with clauses like SELECT, FROM, WHERE, and ORDER BY, each performing specific tasks in data retrieval.</p>

<p><strong>4. Retrieving Data with SELECT:</strong> Use the SELECT command to fetch specific columns or entire tables. Understand how to write basic queries to retrieve information from tables and display it in rows and columns.</p>

<p><strong>5. Filtering Data with WHERE:</strong> Use the WHERE clause to filter records. For instance, if you want data only for customers from a specific city, use WHERE city = 'Chicago'. Understand the importance of logical operators (AND, OR, NOT) for compound conditions.</p>

<p><strong>6. Sorting Data with ORDER BY:</strong> Use the ORDER BY clause to sort results in ascending or descending order, allowing better data organization based on a particular column.</p>

<p><strong>7. Using DISTINCT:</strong> Learn to use DISTINCT to remove duplicates in query results, which is helpful for seeing unique values in a column.</p>

<p><strong>8. Introduction to Aggregate Functions:</strong> Start using aggregate functions like COUNT (to count records), SUM (to add values), AVG (to calculate averages), MAX (to find the highest value), and MIN (to find the lowest value) for summarizing data.</p>

<p><strong>9. Grouping Data with GROUP BY:</strong> The GROUP BY clause groups records by a specific column, allowing you to perform aggregate functions on each group.</p>

<p><strong>10. Mini Project:</strong> Write SQL queries to retrieve, filter, and sort data from a sample database. Practice grouping and using basic aggregate functions to understand data structure and organization.</p>

        <div class="week">
            <h3>Week 2: Advanced SQL Queries and Joins</h3>
<p>This week expands on basic querying by introducing JOINs, allowing data to be combined from multiple tables, making SQL more powerful for relational databases.</p>

<p><strong>1. Introduction to JOINs:</strong> Understand what JOINs are—techniques for combining rows from two or more tables based on related columns. JOINs are essential for working with relational databases that use multiple tables.</p>

<p><strong>2. INNER JOIN:</strong> Learn how INNER JOIN works to return only records with matching values in both tables. INNER JOIN is the most commonly used type for merging data from related tables.</p>

<p><strong>3. LEFT JOIN / RIGHT JOIN:</strong> LEFT JOIN returns all records from the left table and the matched records from the right table (unmatched records from the right table will appear as NULL). RIGHT JOIN works similarly, but it returns all records from the right table instead.</p>

<p><strong>4. FULL JOIN:</strong> FULL JOIN returns all records when there is a match in either table. It combines both LEFT and RIGHT JOIN behaviors, showing all unmatched rows from both tables.</p>

<p><strong>5. Self JOIN:</strong> A JOIN that allows a table to be joined with itself. It is useful for comparing rows within the same table, such as finding employees who share the same manager.</p>

<p><strong>6. Using Subqueries:</strong> A subquery is a query nested within another SQL query, allowing complex data retrieval. Subqueries are helpful for filtering, updating, or combining data in more sophisticated ways.</p>

<p><strong>7. UNION and UNION ALL:</strong> UNION combines results from multiple SELECT statements, excluding duplicates. UNION ALL is similar, but it includes duplicates, which can be useful when duplicates have meaning.</p>

<p><strong>8. Aliasing (AS):</strong> Use aliases to assign temporary names to tables or columns in a query, making them easier to reference or read.</p>

<p><strong>9. Common Table Expressions (CTEs):</strong> CTEs are named temporary result sets. They make complex queries more readable by breaking them down into steps and making them reusable within the same query.</p>

<p><strong>10. Mini Project:</strong> Create SQL queries to combine data from multiple tables using JOINs. Practice using subqueries, UNION, and CTEs to manage and analyze data from a relational database.</p>

            <h3>Week 3: Data Manipulation and Functions</h3>
			<p>This week covers the fundamentals of data manipulation, allowing you to modify database records and use functions to work with strings, numbers, and dates.</p>
			
			<p><strong>1. INSERT Statements:</strong> Use the INSERT command to add new rows of data to a table. Learn different ways to insert single or multiple records.</p>
			
			<p><strong>2. UPDATE Statements:</strong> Use UPDATE to modify existing records. Learn to target specific rows with the WHERE clause to avoid unintended changes.</p>
			
			<p><strong>3. DELETE Statements:</strong> Use DELETE to remove rows from a table. Understand the importance of the WHERE clause to prevent accidental deletions of all records.</p>
			
			<p><strong>4. Using Transactions:</strong> A transaction is a sequence of one or more SQL operations treated as a single unit. Transactions ensure that operations are fully completed or fully rolled back in case of errors.</p>
			
			<p><strong>5. ROLLBACK and COMMIT:</strong> Learn how to use COMMIT to finalize a transaction or ROLLBACK to undo it. This is essential for maintaining data integrity when performing multiple updates.</p>
			
			<p><strong>6. String Functions:</strong> Work with string functions like CONCAT (to combine strings), LENGTH (to get string length), and UPPER (to convert to uppercase). String functions help in managing text data.</p>
			
			<p><strong>7. Numeric Functions:</strong> Use numeric functions like ROUND (to round numbers), CEIL (to round up), and FLOOR (to round down). These functions are helpful for mathematical calculations.</p>
			
			<p><strong>8. Date and Time Functions:</strong> Work with date and time functions such as CURRENT_DATE (current date), NOW (current timestamp), and DATE_FORMAT (formatting dates).</p>
			
			<p><strong>9. Casting and Converting Data Types:</strong> Use CAST and CONVERT to change data types, which is essential for ensuring compatibility in operations involving different data types.</p>
			
			<p><strong>10. Mini Project:</strong> Perform data manipulation tasks on a sample database. Use SQL functions to manipulate text, numbers, and dates. Test transactions and ensure data integrity.</p>
